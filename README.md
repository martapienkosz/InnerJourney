## Inner Journey. Multisensory Gallery experience in Virtual Reality

### Artist Statement

The renaissance of scientific interest in psychedelics uncovered some fascinating connections between the brain and the mind. Scientists hope psychedelics can help us unravel some of the mysteries of consciousness. A peer-reviewed study in 2006 showed that a high, safely administered dose of psilocybin can stimulate mystical experiences - transcending one’s identification with the physical states and ego, as well as a sense of connection to nature and the universe at large.

This VR experience documents some of Lisette’s manifestations of cosmic consciousness, which she experienced during psychedelic trips and preserved in the form of poems.

The virtual realm recreates some of the excessively inaccessible mystical sensations of psychedelic states. Taking advantage of this medium, the space takes users into an alternate reality of one’s own mind and provides a multisensory experience where monologues are supported by abstract visuals generated with TouchDesigner. The user explores the space through its winding corridors leading to semicircular rooms that both stimulate the spirit of exploration and give a sense of intimacy allowing the user to lose themselves in the freedom of their own mind. The headset fully disconnects them from reality.

Everything worked fine until I started to intensively add new "spheres", instances of the clay. Everything started to excessively lag.

**Strongly Recomended** If you have a VR headset, do not hesitate to play our project on it. Here is the release. If you don’t have a VR headset right now, watch a video walkthrough of the VR experience.

## Introduction

*"Step into a world beyond human consciousness. The renaissance of scientific interest in psychedelics hopes to unravel the mysteries of consciousness. Psychedelics are capable of inducing mystical-like sensations, transcending one’s identification with the physical self, and a sense of connection to nature and the universe at large.*

*The multi-sensory art exhibits scattered around this space stimulate some of the sensations that Lisette experienced during her psychedelic trips. You are encouraged to explore the space at your own pace and use the interactive card to activate the soundscapes."*
